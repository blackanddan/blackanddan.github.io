        <div id="sec"><h1 class="heading">PARC: Proximity</h1>
            <h2>PC Gamer</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/">PC Gamer</a></h2>
            <img id= "acc" src="./images/pcgamer.png" alt="PC Gamer">
            <p>PC Gamer shows really well how the layout is for moblie browsers.  You can see they care about people who surf the web with the applications used on a smartphone if they don't have an app for it.  Proximity shows very well on layout and spacing for the webpage.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="sec">
            <h1 class="heading">PARC: Alignment</h1>
            <h2>One Plus</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/">One Plus</a></h2>
            <img id="oneplus" src="./images/oneplus.png" alt="One Plus">
            <p>Alignment is meaning that the website is formatted in a way where text or objects are aligned from left, right, centered, or justified. With the OnePlus website, they show that they're able to have a neatly displayed site that doesn't seem overbearing or confusing when reading.</p>

        <div id="sec">
            <h1 class="heading">PARC: Repetition</h1>
            <h2>CNET</h2>
            <h2><a href="https://www.cnet.com/">CNET</a></h2>
            <img id="cnet" src="./images/cnet.png" alt="cnet">
            <p>Repetition focuses on the website repeating itself.  Typically you can see patterns. Like C|Net's website, they show the design of the site mainly in a gradient, black or white.  The empty spaces are neatly finished with text.  This keeps it interesting for those who view the site.</p>
